This solution is a Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) application built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **Python** for backend logic. It integrates the **Google Gemini API**, specifically the **Gemini 2.5 Flash model**, to convert natural language questions about health metrics into executable SQLite queries. These queries are then run against a local SQLite database (`mock_data.db`), and the results are displayed in an interactive dashboard within the Streamlit application, allowing users to easily analyze their data without needing SQL knowledge.
